The rapid advancement of digitalization and the escalating amount of data are significantly
broadening the cybersecurity threat landscape. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are
extensively employed alongside firewalls to protect networks. However, conventional IDS
operate statically, rendering them vulnerable to obsolescence and necessitating costly
retraining. This paper introduces an incremental majority voting approach for IDS that
leverages current tools and methodologies to enhance resilience and flexibility in intrusion
detection. We utilized multiple datasets, including CIC IDS 2017, NSL KDD, KDD Cup, and
CIC IDS 2018, to evaluate the system's performance. The proposed model integrates various
algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Softmax Logistic Regression (LR), Random
Forest, and Hierarchical Adaptive Tree (HAT)/Decision Tree, culminating in a Voting
Classifier combining KNN, LR, RF, and DT, as well as a Stacking Classifier using RF and DT
with Bagging. Our results demonstrated that the Stacking Classifier achieved an impressive
accuracy of 97.9%, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing intrusion detection capabilities
while adapting to continuous streams of network traffic.
